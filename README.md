# Prodigy Infotech Internship - Task 02

## 📌 Task Description
**Task-02: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models**  
Utilize pre-trained generative models like **DALL·E-mini** or **Stable Diffusion** to create images from text prompts.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Google Colab  
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Diffusers (Stable Diffusion pipeline)  
- Pre-trained text-to-image models  

---

## 📑 Approach
1. Set up the environment in **Google Colab**.  
2. Installed required libraries (`transformers`, `diffusers`, etc.).  
3. Loaded a pre-trained **Stable Diffusion** model.  
4. Defined multiple text prompts to generate images.  
5. Collected and saved **3 output images** for submission.

## 🖼 Generated Images
The generated images are available inside the [`generated_images/`](generated_images) folder.  

### 🔹 Image 1
**Prompt:** *"An ancient stone temple hidden deep in the jungle with sunlight shining through the trees."*
